# HCUP Feature Engineering

Code to take a given HCUP database, filter it based on certain diseases and add a bunch of features for the diseases, complications and medical team. 

## Getting Started

Download the python file - diseaseCoding.py and place it in the folder with HCUP data present. 
To run the file simply run 'python diseaseCoding.py' in a terminal. 
The code will output a file 'filteredData.csv' in the folder which will contain the new filtered dataset with additional features.

### Prerequisites

This requires np and pandas to be installed.
